{"name":"Menumizer","body":"##Menumizer\r\n\r\nMenumizer is a simple jQuery library for making menus responsive.  The idea is to convert all menus within a given element into `<select>` list to make them easier to use on the device.  \r\n\r\nMenumizer works by taking three main parameters:\r\n\r\n`stateController` - callback function that takes the `minPoint` paramter and determines whether the menus should be converted to selects, or should they be converted back to regular menus.  Defaults to being triggered on window wize <= `minPoint`  \r\n\r\n`minPoint` - an integer determining when the menumizer would trigger\r\n\r\n`menumize` - an object containing jQuery objects of the menus to be converted UL.  \r\n\r\n`smush` - an object containing objects that contain menus that need to be merged together when converted.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Mobile Friendly Menus","google":"UA-31442688-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
